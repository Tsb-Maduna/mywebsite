				<h3> Portfolio Website </h3>
				
				<h5 class = "text-start"> Goal: </h5>
				<p class = "text-start">
					The goal of this portfolio website is to showcase my skills, projects, and growth as a computer science student and a juniour software developer. 
					It serves as a space where I document my learning journey, demonstrate my problem-solving approach, and present real-world projects I have worked on. 
					Beyond highlighting technical abilities, this portfolio reflects my creativity, discipline, and passion for building meaningful digital solutions, 
					while providing potential employers and collaborators with insight into how I think, learn, and create.
				</p>
				
				<h5 class = "text-start"> Progress: </h5>
				<h6 class = "text-start">Tuesday, 23 December 2025 </h6>
				<p class = "text-start">
					At this stage, I have built a solid and professional portfolio website that clearly represents my skills and direction.
					The site features a responsive, well-structured layout, and clearly defined sections.
					I have also established a system for documenting project progress and learning milestones, 
					allowing the portfolio to showcase not only completed work but also my problem-solving approach, consistency, and growth as a developer.
				</p>
				
				<h5 class = "text-start"> Next Step: </h5>
				<h6 class = "text-start">Tuesday, 23 December 2025 </h6>
				<p class = "text-start">
					The next phase of my portfolio development focuses on optimization, perfomance, and visibility. 
					I plan to improve the website's search engine ranking through effective SEO practices, perfomance tuning, and clean, accessible code. 
					To enhance development efficiency and maintain consistency, I will leverage the use of CDNs. 
					This approach allows me to focus on scalability, maintainability, and delivering a polished, professional user experience.
				</p>
				
				<h5 class = "text-start"> Reflection: </h5>
				<h6 class = "text-start">Tuesday, 23 December 2025 </h6>
				<p class = "text-start">
					With this project being my first, I had a lot of realisations from the moment I started with it.
					The major thing I realised is that I should have started the project with this "documentation" page, 
					as it would have allowed me to have a proper vision and enforce me to follow a smooth timeline with already set deadlines.
					From this experience I note the importance of documentation. 
				</p>
				<p class = "text-start">
					This project pushed me from a comfort zone and led me to self learning how to publish on Github,
					it introduced me to some basics of Javascript which opened my mind to a lot of possibilities that I intend to turn into real solutions. 
					Most importantly, the success of this project motivates me to grow with an attitude that is bigger, smarter and better towards upcoming projects.
